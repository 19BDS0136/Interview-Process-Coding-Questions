"""
Given an array of N integers (negative integers allowed) which say likings of
N foods by a customer

Time taken to prepare a food arr[i] is i

like-time co-efficient of food is defined as i*arr[i]. Sum of like-time
co-efficients can be obtained by doing the add up of i*arr[i]

Find the maximum sum of like-time co-efficients that can be achieved from
a given array.

Hint: Consider all combinations of likings from a given array.
