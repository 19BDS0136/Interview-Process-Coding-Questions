#### Confusion matrix for any classification algorithm is showed and what are precision and recall values from the matrix?  
  
+ **What is precision**: `Number of True Positives / (Total number of Total Positives and False Positives)`  
+ **What is Recall** : `Number of True Positives / (Total Number of Total Positives and False Negatives)`
