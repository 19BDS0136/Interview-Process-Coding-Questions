#### 1. Confusion matrix for any classification algorithm is showed and what are precision and recall values from the matrix?  
  
+ **What is precision**: `Number of True Positives / (Total number of Total Positives and False Positives)`  
+ **What is Recall** : `Number of True Positives / (Total Number of Total Positives and False Negatives)`  

#### 2. How do you deal with overfitting in your machine learning model?  
  
+ Regularization - (LASSO or Ridge Regression) (L1 and L2 regularization).  
+ K-Fold cross validation with variable K.  
+ Resampling of Train and Test splits of a datasets, sometimes involve out-of-time validation dataset.  
+ Dimensionality Reduction in case many features.  
+ Ensemble Learning.
